## Andrew Farmer

My interests include programming
language design in general and specifically the compilation and optimization
of functional languages.
I am currently working on [HERMIT](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/csdl/fpg/software/hermit.html),
a GHC plugin for transforming Core Language programs.
I am interested in making HERMIT useful for prototyping and debugging GHC optimizations.
In the past I worked on testing and debugging tools for
the [Kansas Lava](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/csdl/fpg/software/kansas-lava.html) project.

I also created [Scotty](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty), a small framework
for specifying RESTful web services.
