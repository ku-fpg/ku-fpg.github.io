title: What Do Professors Do?
---

What does a professor do? Who are they accountable to? Why are they sometimes really busy,
and sometime have time for long discussions?

### Responsibilities 

Professors have three main responsibilities.

 * Teaching
 * Research
 * Service
 
This is reflected in the [mission on the University](http://www.ku.edu/about/mission/).

I'm on a 30%/50%/20% allocation. That is, I'm expected to spend 30% of my time on teaching
and instruction, 50% of my time on research (publishing, pushing the frontiers of knowledge),
and 20% of my time on service (mainly committees, including peer review). I am assessed annually
based on this allocation.

#### Teaching

Each class is expected to take about, on average, 10% of my annual workload. That is around 12 hour per week, during the semester is in session. So there is approximately 3 hour of class time per week,
and 9 hours of preparing lectures and homeworks, grading, answering questions, class hours, and class administration. New classes, and classes that are being re-tools take longer, some classes take less, but 12~15 hours is a good ballpark figure for how long a class takes over a semester.

I teach 3 classes per year, and the Computer Science module of a special one-of class for engineering undecideds (ENGR 108).

#### Research

We are expected to have a sustainable and funded research program. That is we have a research output
that reflects our 50% effort, and we do so by funding students to do research. You can read more about
my [research](/research/), and see what we have [published](/publications/). 

We also have the [Lab Rules](/research/Lab_rules/).

#### Service

This is what keeps academia, and research, running. I help with various committees at the departmental 
level, serve on the ACM SIGPLAN Executive Committee. I also do a lot of peer reviews. In 2015, I 
served on the program committees for ICFP, FCCM, PEPM, TFP, and IFL, and I served on a NSF grant 
review panel. Each committee required reading and reviewing a paper (or grant) in detail, and writing 
an in-depth report about what you have read. Each report can take up to 10 hours, and in some cases, 
you can have up to 20 papers to review. The committees sometimes include travel to a face-to-face 
meeting, to select the best papers, though some committees meet online. I also do journal reviews, which also take around 10 hours, but do not involved any meetings. 

The 20% allocation, a day a week, is
probably on the low side - most reviewers do reviewing after hours.


### Appointments

Professors are appointed for 9 months. That is, we are paid by the University for 9 months during the Spring and Fall semesters, are are not paid by the University during the summer. 

As a research-active professor, I am expected to find
my own funding over the summer, typically from federal sources like the
[National Science Foundation](http://nsf.gov/) - I would be unable to make my 50% research commitment
without finding additional funding. Each project provides typically a month of summer,
so professors work on many project over the summer. Depending on the rules of funding, we
may or may not be able to engage in other activities during the summer. 

This split means that our focus during the semester is quite different that the focus during the summer. I am not allowed to take an outside job over the summer without jumping through additional hoops - we are still covered by the University IP policy over the summer.

Assuming the service aspect is constant at 20% throughout the year, this means I have

Semesters:

 * 40% teaching
 * 40% research
 * 20% service
 
Summer:

 * 0% teaching
 * 80% research
 * 20% service
 
Some professors are not research active. So they have up to 8 classes per year, 
as well as university service, and are not paid over the summer.
