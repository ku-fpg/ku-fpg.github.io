title: Software Projects
---
We build tools and libraries, typically written in Haskell, to explore and validate our
ideas. The main research challenge we are addressing is improving the
high-assurance narrative for functional languages. We release our tools
open source, under a BSD license, use GIT for version control, and
GitHub for external contributions.

This page is a software-centric view of our research. Please email us if you
are interested in contributing, or want more details about a specific
tool. We also maintain a [Research Projects](/research) webpage,
which gives the research-centric view of the FPG lab.

Other Libraries
---------------

All these libraries are on hackage.

-   [dotgen](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dotgen) A simple
    interface for building .dot graph files, for input into the dot and
    graphviz tools. It includes a monadic interface for building graphs.
-   [httpd-shed](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/httpd-shed) A
    trivial web server that can be used to build Ajax and other
    interactive applications in Haskell.
-   [io-reactive](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-reactive) An API
    for generating reactive objects that mimic the reactive model used
    used in the TIMBER programming language.
-   [marked-pretty](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/marked-pretty) A
    compatible extension to pretty that allows marking and scoping of
    the output document. A typical application is outputting pretty HTML
    with style attributes like bold and color.
-   [sized-types](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sized-types)
    Providing indices, matrixes, sparse matrixes, and signed and
    unsigned bit vectors.
