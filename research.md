We use functional programming to solve problems in ways that are
amicable to acceleration (GPUs, Multi-cores, FPGAs), and supports
assurance arguments (using semi-formal methods like equational
reasoning). As a group we make aggressive use of functional languages,
extending the technology where needed, and ultimately strive to close
gaps between high level specifications and highly efficient
implementations. We then deploy our new technologies into diverse
application areas, including telemetry, high performance computing and
real-time systems.

Our operating assumption is that a well written functional program can
perform effectively as a concise executable specification of a
solution to a problem. However, the scope and influence of our ideas
is intended to be broader than simply their use inside our functional
language community.

# Overview of Research

It is possible to write specification style, high-level implementation
(or model) in our language of choice, Haskell, as well as in other
languages. This model may be relatively efficient as a model, but be
completely unsuitable for deployment. The model may lack specific
fidelity details, or be intended for a platform with a small
footprint, or deployment may have unrealizable throughput
requirements. All of these concerns can be addressed, and addressed
from within our language of choice, but at the cost of compromising
the clarity of the original specification.

It is also possible to write very fast programming in Haskell, or
programs that use finite heap, so could be run on an embedded
platform, or can be captured using a technique called deep embedding,
so they could be cross compiled onto alternative platforms like FPGAs
or graphics cards. However, each of these techniques fundamentally
compromised some level of clarity, and therefore negating one of the
reasons to use a functional language in the first place.

As a group, we want to be able to use functional programming language
technology as a bridge between both these programming styles, or more
generally between specification and implementation. At the University
of Kansas, we are addressing this gap using two separate techniques.

First, we are looking at deep compiler optimizations which
fundamentally revisit the optimizing possibilities of a Haskell
program. At the heart of these principled optimizations is the Worker
Wrapper transformation.  Second, we are looking at ways of expressing
and implementing Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) which are stylized
libraries that give an engineered compromise between clarity, elegance
and efficiency.  Separately, both these technologies address
outstanding problems, and ofter viable solutions. Ultimately we want
to join both research threads, and have the DSL technologies become
the target of our aggressive optimizations, closing the loop and
bridging the gap between specification and implementation.
