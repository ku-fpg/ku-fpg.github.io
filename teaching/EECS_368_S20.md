title: "EECS368: Programming Language Paradigms"
---

The course is a survey of programming languages: their attributes,
uses, advantages, and disadvantages. Topics include scopes, parameter
passing, storage management, control flow, exception handling,
encapsulation and modularization mechanism, reusability through
genericity and inheritance, and type systems.  In particular, several
different languages will be studied which exemplify different language
philosophies (e.g., procedural, functional, object-oriented, logic,
scripting, cloud-based).

## Homework

Write a function, in JavaScript, that implements the sieve of
Eratosthenes.  The function should take an upper bound, and return an
array of primes.

Use the higher-order function filter to perform the filter.

You will need to call filter from inside a loop.

Remember filter does not change an array, but generates a new array.

Provide test-cases. For example

  > primes(10)
  [2,3,5,7]
  ...

Due: Friday 6th, at start of class

Hand in:

  * [QR cover sheet, from webpage](/workbook/EECS_368/)
  * Your hw3.js file 
    (this can include test cases, or you can use a second file)

Time estimate:
  * 2 hours to solve
