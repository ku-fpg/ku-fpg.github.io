---

The course is a survey of programming languages: their attributes,
uses, advantages, and disadvantages. Topics include scopes, parameter
passing, storage management, control flow, exception handling,
encapsulation and modularization mechanism, reusability through
genericity and inheritance, and type systems.  In particular, several
different languages will be studied which exemplify different language
philosophies (e.g., procedural, functional, object-oriented, logic,
scripting, cloud-based).
