An introduction to functional programming. Topics include learning how
to program in Haskell; IO and purity in software engineering;
functional data structures and algorithms; monads and applicative
functors; parsing combinators; Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) and
DSL construction; advanced type systems; making assurance arguments;
testing and debugging. 

Prerequisite: EECS 368 or equivalent or consent of instructor.

## Homework 2

Due: Monday 17th at start of class

 * Write 2 versions of each of the following functions.
 
```.haskell
sum :: [Int] -> Int
take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
drop :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
last :: [a] -> a
```

   You should use recursion to operate over the list
 * You should test what you submit
 * You can use `import Prelude hiding (sum, take, drop, last)`
 * Remember to use the [776 QR coversheet](/workbook/EECS_776)
