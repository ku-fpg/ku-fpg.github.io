## Homework

Due: Monday 3rd at start of class

 * Find a ghci interpreter
   * <https://repl.it/languages/haskell> is one example.
   * Or use the lab machines.
   * Or load ghc onto your laptop.
 * Try out the following example
   * Write a function to compute the surface area of a sphere
   * Run the function on a small number of inputs
 * Print your interaction with ghci (what you typed, what ghci said back)
 * Remember to use the [776 QR coversheet](/workbook/EECS_776)
