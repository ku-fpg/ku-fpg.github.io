This course is an introduction to software engineering, and it covers
the systematic development of software products. It outlines the scope
of software engineering, including life-cycle models, software
process, teams, tools, testing, planning, and estimating. It
concentrates on requirements, analysis, design, implementation, and
maintenance of software products. The laboratory covers CASE tools,
configuration control tools, UML diagrams, integrated development
environments, and project specific components. 

Prerequisite: EECS 268 and upper-level EECS eligibility.

## Slides for classes during Online lectures

As discussed, I used Professor Alex Bardas' slides, from 2018, for the pdf parts of the 
online lectures, with live editing to avoid 2018 specifics. 
The 2018 slides are based on Professor Fengjun Liâ€™s EECS 448 Fall 2015 slides,
which where in turn drawn from the class "textbook". 

I've given them here verbatim for use of EECS 448 only,
and there are references to projects that occured in 2018.
I've not attempted to reproduce the live ediiting I did during the lectures
(because I'd make mistakes doing so, and I do not want to obfuscate the lineage
of the slides).
