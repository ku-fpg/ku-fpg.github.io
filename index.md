title: The Functional Programming Group
---

The Functional Programming Group at the University of Kansas apply and extend
functional programming technologies to the diverse areas of building
computer systems, high-performance computing, information assurance, 
virtual reality and telemetry. 
We use functional programming to bring clarity to
descriptions of what we want to compute, and computer language
technologies to provide efficiency and assurance. Typically, we
collaborate with other research groups, deploying our technology and
bringing our research and development expertise to work on our
collaborators' open issues, as well as their assurance and performance
needs.

### Research Thrusts

 * **Reification and Homoiconicity**: We are developing tools for parallelism that use novel compiler technology for high-performance computing
 * **Embedded Systems**: We are working on an Arduino compiler, and a Next Generation Kansas Lava.
 * **Virtual Reality**: We are exploring using VR for teaching, debugging, and (with KU athletics) sport simulators.
 
### Group Composition

The Functional Programming Group at the University of Kansas
is led by [Andrew Gill](/people/andygill).
The group operates inside the Computer Systems Design Laboratory (CSDL), at
ITTC, in Nichols Hall on west campus.

PhD Students:

 * Justin Dawson, Armored Software / Wakarusa
 * [Mark Grebe](/people/markgrebe), Embedded Haskell Systems
 * Brad Torrence, Artificial Life
 * David Young, Wakarusa

MS Students:

 * Chinmay Ratnaparkhi, VR

BS Students:

 * Liia Butler        (VR and Education)
 * Brandon Caudell    (Higher-dimensional Rubik cube in VR)
 * Jackson Montgomery (EECS VR Lab)

### Joining the Group

#### If you are already at KU

New members are always welcome, however, at
the graduate level you will need some experience in Haskell, for
example, via EECS 776.  Email Professor Gill for a discussion,
explaining why functional programming is something you are interested
in exploring.

#### If you are not already at KU

If you are not at KU, and are not planning on applying to KU,
then please outline how you know Haskell, or another functional
language. The lab does not offer scholarships to outside students,
though we have people join from other graduate programs from
time to time. Template requests for sponsorship without FP specifics
will be deleted without acknowledgement.

#### Common Misunderstandings

* We are not a software engineering group. 
We use functional languages to solve problems, which *may* have
a software engineering component.

* There are no *funded* research openings right now. 

### Collaborations and Other Activities

CDSL at ITTC also hosts the [System Level Design
Group](https://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/sldg_wiki/index.php/Main_Page) (SLDG),
lead by [Perry Alexander](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~alex/), who also uses
functional programming for system engineering, and with whom we
collaborate closely.


SLDG and FPG jointly run the [LAMBDA reading
group](https://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/lambda/Main_Page) for anyone that is
interested, discussing topics related to programming and specification
languages, semantic models, and programming paradigms.

We have an IRC group, **#ku-csdl**, on irc.freenode.net.
We also use a subreddit, <code>/r/csdl/</code>,
and use github <https://github.com/ku-fpg/>.
