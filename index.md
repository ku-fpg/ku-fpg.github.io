title: The Functional Programming Group
---

The Functional Programming Group at the University of Kansas apply and extend
functional programming technologies to the diverse areas of building
computer systems, high-performance computing, information assurance and
telemetry. We use functional programming to bring clarity to
descriptions of what we want to compute, and computer language
technologies to provide efficiency and assurance. Typically, we
collaborate with other research groups, deploying our technology and
bringing our research and development expertise to work on our
collaborators' open issues, as well as their assurance and performance
needs.

## Group Composition

The Functional Programming Group at the University of Kansas 
is led by Andy Gill.
The group operates inside the Computer Systems Design Laboratory (CSDL), at
ITTC, in Nichols Hall on west campus.

### Joining the Group

New members (that are already at KU) are always welcome. Typically, at
the graduate level you will need some experience in Haskell (for
example, via EECS 776.  Email Professor Gill for a discussion.
If you are not at KU, and are not planning on applying to KU,
then please outline how you know Haskell, or another functional
language. The lab does not offer scholarships to outside students,
though we have people join from other graduate programs from
time to time.

### Collaborations and Other Activities

CDSL at ITTC also hosts the [System Level Design
Group](https://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/sldg_wiki/index.php/Main_Page) (SLDG),
lead by [Perry Alexander](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~alex/), who also uses
functional programming for system engineering, and with whom we
collaborate closely.



SLDG and FPG jointly run the [LAMBDA reading
group](https://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/lambda/Main_Page) for anyone that is
interested, discussing topics related to programming and specification
languages, semantic models, and programming paradigms.

We have an IRC group, **#ku-csdl**, on irc.freenode.net.
We also use a subreddit, <code>/r/csdl/</code>,
and use github <https://github.com/ku-fpg/>.
