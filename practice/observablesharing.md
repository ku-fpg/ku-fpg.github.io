title: Observable Sharing
---

**Observable Sharing** is where the sharing implicit in a set of data-structures can be observed.

IO-based reification, as implemented by
[data-reify](http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/data-reify),
provided the ability to turn recursive structures into explicit graphs.
Many (implicitly or explicitly) recursive data structure can be given
this ability, via a type class instance. 
It is a key piece of technology used in many reification and synthesis
libraries.
