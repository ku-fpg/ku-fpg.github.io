title: Lab Rules
---

We are a research lab, working on funded research, and discovering things that were not previous known.

Here are the lab rules.

### Tolerance

 * The lab is informal; everyone is different.
 * I have a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination.
 * If you feel uncomfortable in the lab for any reason, tell me.
 * If you can not talk to me, then talk to the center director, Perry Alexander.

### Crunch Times and Lab Cycles

 * Much of our work is done during the summer, when we work full time, and breaks.
 * Things are intended to balance out to your assigned percentage.
 * Right before paper and proposal deadlines are busy times.
 * We tend to get less done during exam week, and big classwork deliverables.

### Deadlines

 * Any paper or proposal needs to be in draft form 7 days before the deadline,
   and a submittable form 2 days before the deadline.
 * We use a lab-public list of TODOs on the final days of a submission, called our landing plan.
 
### Lab Hours

 * The majority of your work should be done in the lab.
 * Right before a deadline, you can work where ever you need to get things done,
   as long as you are accessible and productive.
 * Generally, you should try be in the lab when possible, and it
   be the center of your campus operations, in the same way a professor
   has an office as their center of operations.

### Adults

 * I treat students as adults. You are responsible for your results,
   deliverables, and managing your time.

### Assessments

 * I value *results*, not effort. I am also assess by my peers, and my
   University, on results.
 * If you ask me how you are doing, then I will tell you.
 * A professor's job is giving positive *and* negative assessments
   about your results.

### Equipment

 * I will provide you a desk and a computer in the lab in ITTC,
   if you ask for it.
 * All funded students will get a desk and a computer.
 * If there are issues, ITTC help (help@ittc.ku.edu) 
   are fantastic at fixing things. Please ask them for help.
 * If you want to use your own equipment, for example a personal
   laptop, then I'm fine with this.
 * If your personal laptop, home computer,car, etc, breaks,
   then it is your responsibility, in your own time, to fix it,
   if you choose to do so.
 * KU, NSF and DARPA do not provide/fund laptops to students.
   This is the reality in the ground. 
   This rule came into play, much like the rules on this page, because
   someone misused the original policy.

### Github 

 * We do most of our work in the open on github, (<http://github.com/ku-fpg>).
 * We check in early and often. Draft of code, or text is just fine.
 * Work is not done until it is checked in.
 * We work in private repos for proposals and papers, which are lab-confidential.
 
### MS Projects

 * If you are working on a project with me, then these rules apply.
 * Different MS project students have different levels of activeness in the lab.
 * Critically, all MS project should be done using version control.

### Reporting 

 * *All* students must send me a weekly status report, via email,
   before start of business on Monday.
 * If you do not send me one, I will assume that nothing was done that week.
   (Which might be okay, it might not)

### The 20% Rule

 * If you are managing your time well, I support spending a small but
   significant part of your time on a side project or pet project. If
   you have a half-time student, this would be approximate one morning
   a week.
 * Working on a side project is not a reason for not meeting deadlines,
   or not making deliverables.
 * This project falls under the same IP rules as other assigned projects.
 * One such side project that I did when I was a graduate student was
   [Happy](https://www.haskell.org/happy/), jointly with Simon Marlow.
 * Another side project, by Andrew Farmer, is 
   [Scotty](https://github.com/scotty-web/scotty/wiki).



### Funded Students

Funded students are under additional rules.

 * If you are are a GRA, the you typically work 1/2 time. I expect 20 hours of work, on average, every week.
