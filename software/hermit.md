The **Haskell Equational Reasoning Model-to-Implementation Tunnel**
(HERMIT) is a GHC plugin that allows post-hoc transformations
to be applied to Haskell programs, after compilation has started.
HERMIT can be used for program-specfic optimizations,
domain-specific optimzations, or for constructing semi-formal
assurance arguments.
